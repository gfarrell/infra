# Gideon's Personal Infrastructure

This project is designed to implement and run my personal infrastructure, which
is composed of:

* GNU Mailman instance to run my mailing lists
* Jenkins CI to build my projects
* Nginx serving a couple of static sites

All these services are run inside docker containers.
